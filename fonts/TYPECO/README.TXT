Cypher7 Regular (Indie Fonts Bonus Font)Designed by James Grieshaber at Typeco in 2002The Cypher Family started as an experiment in minimalism. It is called Cypher because at inspection at larger sizes it looks almost like some sort of code, but at smaller sizes the Gestalt principal of closure takes over and it becomes very readable. It has a techno/digital look to it -- I hope you have fun with it.This "Bonus Font" on this CD is for your use only (as per the attached license agreement).
