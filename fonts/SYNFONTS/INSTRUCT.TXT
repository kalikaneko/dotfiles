                                                      What type of font do I need?

                                                         Each systems needs are different.
                    Postscript fonts are used primarily in high resolution applications and are recommended for most graphics needs.

            Truetype fonts are usually the best bet if you are printing from a stylewriter type printer or just using your fonts for on screen use.

                                     If you request it, I'll send both truetype and postscript fonts with your order.
