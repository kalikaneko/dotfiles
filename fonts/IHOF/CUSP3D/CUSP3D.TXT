P22 Cusp Three Dee designed by James Grieshaber, Rochester, New York, USA


P22 created Cusp Three Dee as an exclusive font for our customers only. It is a thank you for past patronage. No sale or redistribution is allowed. It is a decorative variation of the Cusp font family offered by P22's International House of Fonts division. 

James Grieshaber received a BFA in Graphic Design from Rochester Institute of Technology. His continuing self-education in typography has led to his interest in the evolution of the Latin alphabet. He also has a special interest in modern, experimental and new alphabets. Grieshaber worked as an art director for a newspaper and advertising agencies and is currently with P22 type foundry.

Cusp Three Dee was inspired by Art Deco lettering. The designer imposed a strict DeStij grid on the letterforms during their development. Influences of rave/techno design styles appear in the lowercase letterforms. The result is a distinctly contemporary display font.

The Regular P22 Cusp Family contains four fonts: P22 Cusp Round, P22 Cusp Round Slant, P22 Cusp Square, and P22 Cusp Square Slant. The special member of this font family, Cusp Three Dee, was designed as a display font and, therefore, is most effective at large point sizes.

The P22 Cusp family is licensed exclusively to P22 type foundry/International House of Fonts.
