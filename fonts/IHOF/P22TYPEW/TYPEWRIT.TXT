P22 Typewriter font

This typewriter font is not overly distressed, nor is it overly clean. It is a simple monospaced typewriter font.  It is perfect when you want a document to look like it was made on a typewriter. It does feature a full international character set and is compatible with computers which use keyboards based on Western European and Scandinavian languages.

This font is primarily based on the typewriter used for a typographic conference document from 1966 in Mainz Germany. The model and age of the typewriter used is not known. Additional characters were sourced from other vintage typewriters and others were designed to complete the full character set.
