P22 Sinel

This unique font is based on an alphabet drawn in the late 1920s by Joseph Sinel 
(The man who coined the term "Industrial Design"). This font has a basic 
character set (a-z, numbers and basic punctuation). It also features decorative 
extras in the following positions:
$,&,*,+,-,<,>,=,@,\,^,_,`,~,o
As a highly decorative display font, it's range is limited, and works best 
creating short headlines at large point sizes, rather than long lines of text. 

This font is offered for free and available only from P22's website. As a free 
font, no technical support can be offered and no claims are made as to the 
fitness of this font for any given situation. It can be used for personal 
projects and commercial products up to 1000 pieces. For commercial products over 
1000 pieces, a licensing fee will be required. The cost will be $30 for such 
uses. The standard P22 license agreement also applies to multiple users. One P22 
font is licensed for up to 5 users on 1 output device. For a number of users and 
output devices which exceeds this, please call for site license details.

any way is allowed. Copyright (c)2000 P22 type foundry. All rights reserved. 

--- As with all headline fonts and complex dingbats characters, these fonts are 
best used at larger point sizes (i.e. 42, 48, 72, 120). Use in body text or at 
small point sizes may not achieve desired results---
