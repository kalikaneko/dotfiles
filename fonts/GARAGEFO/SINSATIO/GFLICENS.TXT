Phil's Fonts/GarageFonts License Upgrade Schedule

Each Phil's Fonts/GarageFonts Font package is automatically licensed for use 
with five (5) computers (CPUs) at a single (1) location(site) in a single format 
(e.g. Mac PostScript). Licenses for additional CPUs must be purchased. 
Additional formats and/or platforms may be purchased at the same time as the 
original purchase for 50% of the price of the first format. Individual sites, 
persons or business entities must purchase individual licenses beginning with 
the original price. The following upgrade cost schedule is calculated based on 
multiples of the original list price of each font or family:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
6 to 25 CPUs, multiply original font or family price by 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
26 to 50 CPUs, multiply original font or family price by 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
51 to 75 CPUs, multiply original font or family price by 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
76 to 125 CPUs, multiply original font or family price by 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
126 to 175 CPUs, multiply original font or family price by 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
176 to 250 CPUs, multiply original font or family price by 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
251 to 375 CPUs, multiply original font or family price by 8.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
376 to 500 CPUs, multiply original font or family price by 11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------ 
501 to 625 CPUs, multiply original font or family price by 13.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
626 to 750 CPUs, multiply original font or family price by 16
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
751 to 875 CPUs, multiply original font or family price by 18.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
876 to 1000 CPUs, multiply original font or family price by 21 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
For more than 1,000 CPUs use the following formula to get multiplication factor:

CPUs: In increments of 250.
(maximum number of CPUs divided by 100) plus 11 (=Multiplier).

Example: End user has 1350 CPUs, so the Multiple User License price is to be 
calculated as follows:
(1500 divided by 100) + 11 = 26 (= Multiplier)
